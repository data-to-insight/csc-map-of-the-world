contacts_processedprocessed_contacts_refreshedcsv we are going to refresh the contacts sheet with this data its a simple 1 button update - open the main contacts excel sheetfile on your pc this is usually located nvestcontacts - from the ribbon navigate to the data tab - click refresh all from the queries and connections block on the ribbon thats it whether you notice any changes or not all the data in the contacts and events pages is now updated and current --- important further information nvest_contacts_masterxls the master contact sheet itself is not where contacts data should be editedupdated the data sources within nvestcontactsnvest_contacts_master_processing are where any changesedits should be made the reason is that we refresh all the data within the contacts workbook each time we run this process so the source data and not the contacts workbook is our single data source for the actual contacts related data if wanting to store personindividual specific notes or additional data against specific records this can be done using a user defined lookup page in which email address and those related additional columnsdata is stored against them nvest events files the nvest events invitesattended are recorded to assist event planning and checking weve correctly contacted all those that have registered their interest when a new event is planned the full list of current contacts emails should be copied from the master contact sheet overview column email and pasted afresh into into the next free event1 2 3 file do not change the file name or file type here as it will break the onward data flow these are csv files so no formatting can be stored in the file instead if desired such formatting can be added in the nvest_contacts_masterxls in this file event1 2 3 heading can then be changed to reflect the date or another decriptor for each event to be clear col headers can only be modified in the nvest_contacts_masterxls file key take-aways for managing events files - events files cant be renamed - events files are csv so not for annotating with colour formatting - additional columns can be added into events files - but those will not come through into the master contacts -

so determining most recent record not possible so we assume web sign up is more recent as members directed to this input route after having shown interest via another route eg workshop - ensure column order matches requested output order -

put together a free open-source alternative for d2i use and potentially local authority datacolleagues - package key d2i tools in a ready-to-use format ideally that will run on any hardware - make it easier for colleagues to try adopt enjoy and understand open-source tools like python anaconda jupyter and libreoffice - encourage open standards data transparency and independence from software lock-in --- common open source benefits - cost saving no licence fees or platform lock-in - transparency code and tools can be audited and understood - security community-tested widely deployed systems - portability run on almost any hardware - adaptability customise rebuild and redistribute legally - shared knowledge aligns with our principles of collaboration and insight-sharing some public teams are already taking steps to switch away from proprietary platforms eg - were done with teams german state uninstalls microsoft tools - denmark exploring open source alternatives to microsoft by offering a linux-based d2i-ready environment we provide a small but practical step toward possible wider open adoption while also improving our own portability and resilience were learning by doing on this one but there is potential future value in putting together an in-one desktop solution for both d2i or local authority use feedback welcomed accross the board --- what the buildsoftware includes -

    "text": "cin-validator the cin validator is an open source volunteer built tool that allows users to validate cin census data year round via the command line or using the browser based front end url here it also provides a framework which other validation tools can easily be built on top of the functions are documented using sphinx format so that a docs website can be auto-generated if need be also there is an increased use of python type-hints as a form of intrinsic documentation this does not apply to test functions as they neither receive nor return data in the strict sense more extensive documentation can be found here setup this repo can be opened and run in a codespaces instance or cloned locally using git clone if it is cloned locally use pre-commit install to install the pre-commit hooks run - to test that all the rules pass their pytests and will validate data as expected python -m cin_validator test - to list all rules that are present python -m cin_validator list - to run rules on a file and generate a table of error locations python -m cin_validator run -to run rules on the sample data and explore the output of the cli python -m cin_validator run pathtoyourcinvalidatorcin-validatorfake_datafake_cin_dataxml - to run rules on a file and select an instance of an error based on its id python -m cin_validator run -e - to convert a cin xml file to its respective csv tables python -m cin_validator xmltocsv yearly tool updates update rule resources - run python get_uk_holidayspy in the command line this fetches the latest values of bank holidays into cin_validatorengland_holidatespy dont edit this file directly for the rules that need them remember to convert to if you are using a unix operating system update rules - if any rules have been added or changed with respect to the previous year create files for them in a rule folder named after the new validation year for example new or added rules for the 202324 validation year should be created in a folder named cin2023_24 do not copy over rules that havent changed - the __init__py file contains the code that pulls in rules from the previous year and modifies them to meet the current years specification copy across that init file whenever a folder for a new collection_year is created change the import to the name of the previous years folder - if the new specifications require that some rules are deleted add their codes as strings to the del_list array in the current years init file do not delete the rules manually - any new rules or modified rules should be added by creating a file for each rule and writing the modified code or new code even for small modifications create a new file for the rule in the year where the modification was made instead of going backwards into the previous years and editing the original file - to run the modified set of rules from the command line interface you can use the -r or --ruleset flag to specify the name of the rule folder that you wish to run otherwise feel free to update the defaults of the commands so that they point to the new years folder instead for example change cin2022_23 to cin2023_24 make changes available to user this part is a guide on how to update the frontend so that it reflects the changes that have been done in the backend - delete the dist folder completely - update the package version in the pyprojecttoml file there is a section below to help you choose the new number - run poetry install installs project dependencies and then poetry shell ensures project runs in controlled environment in the command line you might have already done this when updating the rules - check that validation rules work as expected pass when you run poetry python -m cin_validator test in the command line - then run poetry build in the command line you will see that this creates a new dist folder - push the pyprojecttoml change to github and do a pull request - when the version-number-change pull request is merged in do a release by navigating to the release page from the right hand control bar on the repo homepage click on releases then draft new release in the top right hand corner - the release tag is created by including a v before the version number which you put in the pyprojecttoml file for example if you filled in version 013 then on github write v013 as your release tag - click on generate release notes at the top right of the main text box commit messages of all changes made since the last release will appear in the text box - create a release title that starts with a ddmmyyy pattern to indicate the date of the release and then you can write a few words to describe the changes made since the last release - take the whl file from the dist folder in this repo go to the publicbindist location in the frontend repo delete the previous cinwhl file in it and add this one - search for the former wheel name on the frontend repo and update all locations where the wheel file name is referenced so that they now point to the new wheel file name with updated version number here is an example - do a pull request to the frontend repo containing your changes - when the frontend pull request is merged in the live tool will be updated automatically you can confirm by checking that the version number in the footer of the web app has changed - you can watch the deployment process in the actions tab on github when your pull request is merged to the frontend - all done notes about choosing version numbers when changes are rules updates adddeletemodify or bug fixes only the last part of the version",

pressures 9 data collection methods 80 73 notes on quantitative data analysis methods and charts 82 references 84 3foreword in march 2024 adcs published a policy position paper called childhood matters which attempted to articulate the impact of austerity on children young people and families as well as the vital public services they rely on it was an update to the 2017 policy paper a country that works for all children sadly in the intervening years precious little had changed and too many things had gone in reverse from rising levels of child poverty and numbers of families needing our help and support to an increasingly difficult fiscal picture for local authorities summer 2024 brought a snap general election and a new government the first autumn budget brought some welcome investment for children and childrens services however we need sustained long-term investment for all local authorities not just some and a plan and vision for childhood and beyond this was the central premise in childhood matters the ninth phase of this longitudinal research covers the period april 2022 up to the end of march 2024 it shows some changes in safeguarding activity which have not previously been seen or not to the extent currently being seen several common threads emerged across data submissions and interviews with leaders from local authorities right across the country including the ongoing and unaddressed impact of the pandemic on children young people and families this is visible in increased mental health needs rising school exclusions and delayed development in the youngest children who were born during the pandemic and started school this year leaders raised a number of concerns about housing from access to affordable good quality housing the use of temporary accommodation overcrowding and an increasingly transient population moving around the country typically but not exclusively from the south to the north due to housing costs such moves break community links and results in disruption to health care and education services many directors of childrens services voiced concerns about childrens health too whether about lengthening delays in accessing assessment and treatment for parents and carers or children and young people themselves the visibility and prioritisation of childrens needs and outcomes in the still relatively new integrated care system structures was also frequently raised as a key strategic concern by leaders perhaps unsurprisingly there were lots of shared concerns about the send system too not just about financial sustainability but the experiences of children and young people with additional needs and disabilities as recent research has shown weve never spent more in this space but this sadly hasnt secured any significant improvements in outcomes over the last decade 4the fabric of communities and the resilience of families as well as public services have been stretched over the last few years this report and a growing body of evidence shows there are links between poverty and childrens social care activity delayed access to public services from the nhs to the family courts is impacting on family functioning and on childrens lives and outcomes andy smith adcs president 202425 5introduction the data explored in this report are from the ninth phase in the safeguarding pressures sp series a unique programme of mixed methods enquiry that shines a light on the pressures facing childrens safeguarding services over the period 200708 to 202324 the purpose of the series is to highlight the needs of children and families and the efforts of those trying to support them to live good lives safeguarding pressures represents a chance to understand child and family safeguarding activity over time using a broader set of data than are published through the annual statutory returns through this data we start to understand some of the challenges that local authorities face as they support children and families in their areas and the impacts of services systems and workforce activity sp9 updates the longitudinal quantitative data collected over the series and brings that together with the reflections of directors of childrens services dcss and their teams gathered in qualitative survey returns and interview discussions data return 124 responses an 81 response rate led by data to insight the local authority owned childrens services data support service all local authorities received an email containing a data collection template inviting them to participate",

govuk nationalarchivesgovuk 3central to the national framework is a belief that the lives of children young people and families can be different and that it is the role and responsibility of those who work in and with childrens social care services to hold tight to this belief achieving the outcomes of the national framework will require the determination of the whole workforce to continually improve practice having high aspirations for families will not be enough everyone needs to ask themselves how those aspirations are shaping their practice and informing the work they do the childrens social care dashboard the national framework will be supported by the childrens social care dashboard the dashboard which will bring childrens social care data together in one place to understand progress towards the outcomes of the national framework the dashboard will include indicators which will provide information on what is happening in practice the initial indicators will be developed from data that is currently available there are limitations with the existing data and over time the indicators in the dashboard will evolve as government addresses data gaps and moves towards collecting data that better helps us understand outcomes for childrens social care the dashboard will serve as a learning tool which should enable local authorities to reflect on their own practice over time as well as to learn best practice from others it should help central government understand system-wide successes and issues identify how much consistency exists in achieving positive outcomes for children young people and families and notice when barriers are being faced the first version of the dashboard will be published in 2024 to support learning and help bring transparency to the outcomes in childrens social care so everyone can work together to continue to improve practice the national framework should be read in conjunction with the childrens social care dashboard and indicator update this outlines the use and purpose of the dashboard and the rationale behind the chosen shortlist of indicators the policy paper also sets out the plan for how we will roll out the dashboard support to embed the national framework local authority senior leaders practice supervisors and practitioners will be interested in reading the accompanying document improving practice with children young people and families this advice sets out the support available to help embed the statutory guidance working together to safeguard children and the national framework in practice 4review date this guidance will be kept under review and updated versions will be issued as necessary what is the status of this guidance this guidance is issued under section",

authority data professionals and supported by the adcs dfe dluhc and ofsted we are a small core team supporting a much wider network of childrens services data people all working together to improve data use in the sector our original informal motto was build once use 150 times and this still represents a core part of our ethos there are many thing that every local authority la needs to do and many of these can be done once in a shared standard way doing this can empower la colleagues both to benefit from good practice shared across the sector and to maximise the value of the time they spend locally on data work the core service maintains excel data tools web tools python code libraries in-year data collections learning opportunities and support documents we also provide community support collaboration support and advocacy we also work on funded projects doing things like data validation demand modelling new data standards and user research la colleagues can sign up to join us at wwwdatatoinsightorg 31 getting started this document offers an overview of the system stakeholders common local practice and necessary knowledge for data professionals working in childrens social care it draws on the work of sector professionals and service leaders to whom we are grateful for generous support advice and in some cases direct contributions childrens social care csc is a unique national system operated by individual local safeguarding authorities las supported by a range of national regional and local organisations and other stakeholders the legislative framework is complex and local implementations can take a range of shapes there is also an extensive statutory data requirement as well as independent regulation the importance and complexity of safeguarding services in this context can make the data landscape difficult to understand particularly given that technical factors including the typical sizes of datasets and common software restrictions within las can mean that not all standard data approaches are appropriate in this context this document is neither exhaustive nor authoritative we do however believe it represents a reasonable introduction to csc and csc data work to contribute either to future versions of this report or to our collaborative community more generally please join us at wwwdatatoinsightorg 4upskilling new colleagues the best way to begin learning how csc works is to shadow front-line services in your organisation half a day shadowing front-line social work colleagues in the csc front door service is an invaluable way to learn the real-world operations which data work attempts to describe and monitor we recommend that all data professionals involved in safeguarding work should be offered this opportunity by their employer this can be further expanded to include cin cp cla fosteringadoption and care leaver support teams over any such period of time as suits the la working alongside experienced technical colleagues is a useful way to learn on the job as is ensuring that new colleagues engage in detail tasks focusing on different service areas with each task they will gain fresh understanding which helps inform their wider view it can also be useful to make time to work alongside local data architects or to gain access to test database instances to allow for learning and data experimentation local safeguarding children partnerships lscp may offer training packages providing an overview alongside local policies statutory frameworks etc generally data professionals should complete all systems and reporting training which is offered to front-line workers they should remember though that training is always introductory understanding the system will be long term work driven by an understanding of their specific duties 5emotional demands of csc data work for some people first-hand exposure to csc practice and the stories of young people and families engaged with csc can be a very challenging experience in terms of emotional demands while its valuable to understand the real work before beginning to perform data analysis on the information we record about that work case files and casework conversations often contain detailed descriptions of serious child abuse as a manager or mentor you must exercise judgement about how to appropriately convey that insight into what the data represent as a new colleague you must remain mindful of your own responses to this kind of experience and material its okay to be deeply upset by stories of family breakdown child abuse or exploitation especially when these are made real to you sometimes by specific details of place or consequence which resonate social workers receive training on this kind of experience and common responses but its far less common for data professionals to do the same in the first instance if you feel that your work or your organisations approach to your professional development is having undue impact on your wellbeing you should speak to your line manager or an appropriate organisational representative managers and organisations should support employees in such a situation and",

    "text": "adapting case management systems for families first nvest briefing may 2025 introduction context this document presents perspectives from 89 local authorities las whose employees attended the nvest general meeting held on 14052025 to discuss the national roll out of families first family help the meeting was attended by tom griffiths from the department for education who gave an update on the programme followed by presentations from dorset and wolverhampton with a particular focus on the challenges of adapting case management systems to meet the requirements for this new way of delivering services in childrens social care a total of 212 people attended the meeting representing 89 local authorities this shows the significance of the interest and challenges these changes are posing in relation to the timescales of the roll out of the programme and the changes required to the existing case management systems the purpose of the document is to share the concerns raised between all local authorities with the department for education and the current cms suppliers in order to open cross-sector dialogue about how best to approach these challenges we hope to achieve a richer understanding of the challenges facing the sector at this time from the perspectives of all parties concerned with the aim of ensuring a well-co-ordinated implementation strategy key messages the clear message coming from local authorities is that the scale of change required to make their case management systems compliant is significant one early implementation authority said they had to postpone all other development work on their case management system to deliver the first pillar of the families first framework they welcome the practice changes but they want the cms adaptation to be right first time an overarching concern is that they are being asked to start to make changes before the dfe guidance is available to support them and their cms suppliers and this includes the statutory reporting requirements for 2027-8 cms suppliers must be confident that the investment they make in their product will meet the new statutory requirements if they do not they could end up having to repeat elements of their development apart from the adverse impact on the suppliers who say they operate in a relatively low-margin market this could also impact on customers who have to implement system changes more than once which is also costly on them las say they would like to see a programme and roadmap agreed which takes their concerns into account and one which recognises that there has to be a specific order in which changes are implemented 1 publication of the 2027-28 statutory data collection specifications to help cms suppliers redesign their products this should also cover transitional reporting requirements ie those reporting items that should continue until the local authority switches to the new family help model 2 generic cms change requirements gathered from pilot and non-pilot sites forming a steering group to ensure these are broad and flexible enough for cms suppliers to translate into product changes that can support the variations in practice and operational services in the local authorities minimising the need for bespoke configuration work by the supplier the steering group should include las from across the 4 suppliers pag e 1 53 consultation activities involving local authorities within their supplier group to assist suppliers in producing specific product specifications that will be released to all customers these should be signed off by the suppliers existing customer advisory boards or equivalent 4 agreement between the suppliers and the dfe about the timescales for developments required both for product changes and eventual deployment to all customers the scale of which we know is likely to vary from product to product some suppliers also have a much larger customer base than others which may also significantly impact on their resource capacity in implementing this quickly 5 a supplier-specific roll out plan for their customer base following the release of the product which could include the steering group members as early adopters so that they can fully test out the changes before the product is rolled out across the entire customer base ensuring there is time to address any critical issues there is uncertainty about the funding available to support the changes required by suppliers and whether sufficient funding will be allocated to local authorities or indeed directly to the suppliers without funding the suppliers might need to pass these costs onto their customers and individual customers will need to negotiate based on the terms of existing contracts with suppliers the cost of migrating client data in order to move children from one categoryworkflow to another should not be underestimated whether this is handled in-house or by the supplier which may also vary between cms suppliers invitation to join this conversation nvest member las have asked for nvest to support them in continued communication and in the co-ordination of any continued la engagement going forward acting as a representative group to enable government and suppliers to engage effectively with a sufficiently broad cross-section of las the nvest steering group is made up of la representatives accountable to the wider nvest community we therefore ask that any response to this document is sent to nvesteastsussexgovuk detailed feedback the following sections provide more granular detail of the issues and concerns expressed during nvest discussion groups the below points are quotes or paraphrases from contributors to nvests meetings about the families first implications for case management systems and data flows comments are not attributed to individual contributors or las in some cases particular comments may be in tension with others discussing the same theme this is because not all las or all participants share identical concerns or challenges when considering these changes comments should not be taken as official statements by specific organisations or individuals but as a cross-section of concerns and ideas which are currently live in the nvest community and which can form useful reference material for further strategic discussion pag e 2 5challenges on local authorities being asked

contributors commentary and analysis by the projects researchdesign teamsthemes there are many positives about current collections current data collectionspublications are felt to be useful particularly rates per 10k of headline measures contributors talked about using a spine of key measures to aid decision making the data is used by a wide range of professionals not just local authorities but also academics charities etc las use the published aggregates in benchmarking exercises while researchers can apply to access disaggregated data having access to historical benchmarking data is seen as a useful tool in decision making and quite unique in local government with other service areas not felt to be as data rich some contributors commented about ways the publications could be more useful examples given include suppression making analysis difficult and an inability to stratify published data lead times for changes to case management systems can be significant often at least 12-24 months contributors felt this has been handled well in main stat return changes where dfe have long lead timesconsultationsstar chamber sign-off process reported as more challenging for other collections where lead times are often significantly lessthemes local authorities are concerned about the use of process data as the primary tool for understanding their services particularly by dfeofsted there is concern about the use of this data as the primary tool for understanding childrens social care csc systems are complex and its felt there is little evidence that process type measures alone can accurately indicate the effectiveness of services within csc services process data is one tool amongst many audit voice of child reflective practice partnership working supervision etc there are myriad sources of soft information used by leaders to understand their services because of this there is some concern from las and beyond that analysis using just this data may not provide accurate understanding by outside agencies this is compounded by mistrust in some las of dfe receiving data particularly when unvalidated this is a recognised view from regulators etc who stress their understanding that data is only used a starting point but not the whole picturethe voice of the child is not clearly evident in the data we use to describe their journey through the social care system policy and guidance is clear services should be child focused and the views of children should be represented and taken seriously looking at casefiles or talking to social workersleaders and also regulators and policy makers this is clearly evident however this focus is not often present in the way we collect publish or talk about data example given of corporate parenting how do you know a council is a good corporate parent to answer this often las will produce a dashboard with cla numbers placement stability etc this is not how parents would generally measure their own success for leaders this is the only available benchmarking are there small ways we could make processes more child focused ie not categorising by is the accommodation suitable but asking young people do you feel safe not measuring what had three or more placements but asking children do you feel secure and happy in your placementwe struggle to understand whether the csc system is making childrens lives better through data outcomes for children were mentioned as a gap in many interviews as a sector we know we need to better understand outcomes but dont currently have the tools to effectively do so at all levels outcomes frameworks are using process measures as a proxy for outcome data supporting families outcomes framework is used in many las but can often be seen as separate to csc and data availability from partners can be challenging while outcomes are difficult at a local level they become more even more so at larger geographies where differences in local need can hinder comparison to measure outcomes las would need to use less commonly used data multi-agency voice of the child there are technical and ethical challenges here what is proportionate and how do children and families feel about thisoutcomes datavoice of the child is difficult and work needs to be done to develop this while these areas were identified as gaps there was no suggestion that these areas were able to be addressed quickly or that there were quick wins available needs fundingdevelopment and appropriate voices around the table and a rethink of general approach to data las want to know that the work they are doing makes a difference to the children they work with they want a rich picture of the childs experience but this does not provide top line figures that are easily sharable local areas will have different needs so challenges in making a one-size-fits all approach an example would be bright spots providing lots of support for las to gain understanding vs sdqs which are standardised and often not fully analysedmulti-agency data is challenging to obtain and analyse increasingly data that is not owned by local authorities is seen as critical to understanding services areas where multi-agency data is regularly used include supporting families safeguarding partnerships and family hubs there is a growing recognition that children and young people cant be seen in isolation from the area that surrounds them contextual safeguarding two challenges are consistently mentioned obtaining the data often this in itself is challenging health data is the most commonly identified as difficult to obtain though all las have different local challenges sourcing partner data understanding the data often aggregated data is provided to",

be working for you as the recently appointed minister for children and families throughout my life i have been dedicated to improving the lives of children families and communities starting my career as a social worker and later focused on projects to alleviate food poverty and improve community safety being part of this governments mission to break down the barriers to opportunity and give each and every child the very best life chances is truly close to my heart childrens social care works with some of the most vulnerable children and has the ability to transform lives the childrens social care national framework statutory guidance sets direction for practice and describes the outcomes we want to see achieved for children young people and families i am pleased to introduce the new childrens social care dashboard which is here as a learning tool to help us all understand how well we are achieving the outcomes we want to see from childrens social care the dashboard should make it easier to understand where there are similarities and differences and where we can learn from others data can support our understanding but social care is complex and it is important that indicators and trends are not viewed on their own the dashboard will not remain static it will evolve over time as we evaluate and iterate it and work to fill key gaps in the data such as understanding the experiences of children and families measuring the effectiveness of multiagency working and better understanding the longer-term outcomes for care-experienced young people while this dashboard provides an opportunity to look at data across different regions and local authorities it does not currently allow us to look at how social care is experienced differently by children with different characteristics we want to give all children the start in life that they deserve and that includes respecting the childs culture language and religion this data is complex and sensitive but we will work with local authorities to analyse and interpret this data so that we can be more transparent about the support we provide to all of our most disadvantaged and vulnerable children 3this government is on a mission to create a new era of opportunity and a fairer society for everybody as the minister for children and families i am proud to be part of this mission which is personal to me i look forward to working alongside partners and stakeholders listening to the voices of children and young people who experience social care to help make their lives better janet daby mp minister for children and families 4introduction the childrens social care dashboard the dashboard and the childrens social care national framework are central to our ambition to set greater national direction for childrens social care and to build a system that can continually learn and improve in december 2023 under the previous government the department published its childrens social care data and digital strategy outlining how data can support and enable local authorities to deliver childrens social care services it sets out the ambition to develop a system that effectively shares childrens social care data to provide necessary insights to those who need it when they need it building public trust in data use the dashboard supports that ambition working to achieve the strategic objective of improving the data we collect share and use by providing timely analysis and insights that inform evidence-based decisions and actions the national framework brings together the purpose of local authority childrens social care the principles by which children young people and families should be supported the enablers that should be in place so that the system is effective and the outcomes that should be achieved so that children and young people can grow up to thrive the dashboard will support the implementation of the national framework by providing insights and learning through a clear visual representation of key metrics and indicators in time this will provide information on what is happening in practice and how the outcomes and enablers set out in the national framework are being achieved the national framework outcomes and enablers which form the context for the dashboard are outcomes 1 children young people and families stay together and get the help they need 2 children and young people are supported by their family network 3 children and young people are safe in and outside of their home 4 children in care and care leavers have stable loving homes 5enablers multi-agency working is prioritised and effective o leaders drive conditions for effective practice o the workforce is equipped and effective o 6journey to develop the dashboard we consulted on the dashboard alongside the national framework between february and may 2023 and sought feedback on a list of suggested indicators following the consultation in december 2023 the department issued the national framework as statutory guidance and published",

sensitiveexecutive summary background for a long time there have been questions raised about the role technology plays in social work two landmark reviews of the childrens social care system have criticised technology for hampering social workers rather than helping them but there has been little movement in redressing this balance due to a number of key factors firstly in respect of case management systems there is little in terms of variety available to the sector two case management system providers dominate the market and local authorities las are often in a position of multi-year contracts secondly whilst many people are keen to see technology improve their access to information the potential benefits of changing systems appear outweighed by the effort and costs associated with this including migrating data and staff training these factors are significant contributors to the market stagnation that is apparent the department for education had heard from the sector that social workers digital tools do not adequately support their information recording retrieval sharing or analysis adding to burdens and not optimally supporting decision- making to respond to this the department for educations dfe data and digital solutions fund ddsf and sought las to demonstrate how advanced technology could deliver improvement through this fund north yorkshire council was provided an opportunity to pilot innovative technologies and solutions aimed at improving information retrieval and analysis and to reimagine case management this work has been an exploration incorporating artificial intelligence ai ai has become a headline topic globally and the timing has meant that there is an appetite to think about safe and ethical use cases for ai within childrens social care csc practice aims this pilot aimed to create two proof-of-concept tools one that provides a search function for previously unsearchable unstructured data and difficult to search structured data and a second tool that creates auto-generated ecomaps showing the networks around children from information held within a csc case management system in the short term it is expected that implementation of these tools would reduce the amount of time social workers spend looking for information reduce their administrative workload and help them understand networks better in the medium term the tool hopes to improve outcomes for children through better understanding of the",
