# Children's Services Knowledge Base

[![Open Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20Source-Yes-brightgreen)](https://opensource.org)
[![Built with Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Streamlit-ff4b4b)](https://streamlit.io)
[![DuckDB Powered](https://img.shields.io/badge/Database-DuckDB-blueviolet)](https://duckdb.org)

An open-source, Git-native 'map of the world' or knowledge base for connected **people**, **projects**, and **organisations** in the **children’s services sector**, aligned to the [Smart City Concept Model/framework (SCCM)](http://www.smartcityconceptmodel.com/).

## Notes / Dev story

- How can/should we structure the (meta) data about every element within the map (csv, db, flat file, .yml...)
- Can|should we store the names of people around the various initiatives/projects (is that relevant/useful and would they want that)
- How do we store the data for retrieval, as we scale up with larger volumes what impact will this have (esp on load/search times)
-

## Dev Notes


I previously considered, Python 3.9+ and the following packages, but have since had to rethink the approach:
```bash
pip install streamlit duckdb pyyaml cerberus
```
---

### Dependencies

Python 3.9+ and the following packages:

# Install MkDocs and theme
```
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material pyyaml
```
# Build JSON for Cytoscape
```
python scripts/build_cytoscape_json.py
```
# Serve docs locally
```
rm -rf site/
mkdocs build &&  mkdocs serve
mkdocs serve --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:8001 # to get round the OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use

```



### Validate YAML Structure

Use the built-in schema validation script:

```bash
python scripts/validate_schema.py
```

This checks for required fields and types based on a lightweight SCCM-aligned schema.

### Rebuild Search Index

DuckDB is used as a fast in-memory index:

```bash
python scripts/build_runtime_index.py
```

You’ll see all records loaded and printed to terminal. If you’re running streamlit run app/Home.py you don't need to do this as build_duckdb_index(records) is automatically called — no need to run it separately.

### Text-to-SQL (Prototype)

You can simulate natural language queries:

```bash
python scripts/nlp_to_sql.py
```

Example input:
```
Who worked on safeguarding in the North West?
```

## Future Plans

- SCCM-compliant JSON-LD export
- GitHub Pages + search index
- Relationship mapping (RELATIONSHIP, EVENT)
- Collaborative edit + merge workflow
