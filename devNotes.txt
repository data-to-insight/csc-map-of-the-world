Strategic policy framework or improvement plan	PLAN
Operational guidance or how-to	METHOD
Mandatory compliance or statutory document	RULE
Joint protocols or memoranda of understanding	AGREEMENT


‚úÖ Primary Recommendation: @type: PLAN
Why:
Most published frameworks:

Define objectives

Outline steps or principles

Are used to guide actions by others (e.g. local authorities)

Often include timelines or recommended resources

üîπ SCCM definition: ‚ÄúA list of steps with times and RESOURCEs, used to achieve an OBJECTIVE.‚Äù

Use for:
Children‚Äôs Social Care National Framework

Kinship Care Strategy

SEND Improvement Plan

Safeguarding Practice Guides

üü® Secondary Options ‚Äî if use case differs:
@type: RULE
Use only if the framework specifies mandatory behaviours or standards, such as statutory guidance or compliance obligations.

üîπ ‚ÄúA regulation or principle governing conduct‚Äù

Use sparingly, for example:

Keeping Children Safe in Education (if you treat it as binding)

ILACS inspection handbook (might also be a RULE or PLAN depending on modelling stance)

@type: METHOD
If the framework is purely procedural (e.g. a toolkit for how to run Family Group Conferences), it may better align with METHOD.

üîπ ‚ÄúA pre-determined procedure, or series of steps, designed to accomplish an OBJECTIVE.‚Äù

@type: AGREEMENT
Use if the framework represents a negotiated approach, such as joint protocols between agencies.
